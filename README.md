### Abstract (of the paper)

Assurance Case Development (ACD) is an emerging approach for demonstrating that a system is safe. A Safety Assurance Case (SAC) includes top-level claims for a property of a system (e.g., safety) and a structured argumentation that breaks down claims into supporting evidence. ACD is an effortful activity that relies on Project Management Information (PMI) and its associated traceability. It is challenging for developers to build SACs as they have to identify and gather the Safety Assurance Information (SAI) relevant to the argumentation and assess its consistency and completeness. However, regular PMI and SAI are likely managed separately. In this context, we designed the AssuRance CAse DEvelopment (ARCADE) framework to support the automated extraction and analysis of SAI from project management tools and the automated generation of SAC arguments. The main novelty of ARCADE is enabling the management of SAI together with PMI inside the regular management tools. Thus, ARCADE retrieves the combined information, performs consistency/completeness analysis, and generates SAC fragments. In this work, we present the design of ARCADE and its current implementation.
